# Amazon ML Entity Resolution

Solution workspace for the **Amazon ML Challenge 2026 — Business Entity Resolution** problem.

Given business records (name, address, country) from three independent sources, the system will
determine which Source 2 and Source 3 records correspond to each Source 1 business. Source 1 is the
deduplicated reference source; each Source 1 entity may match zero, one, or many records.
Submissions are scored with macro-averaged F0.5.

See [docs/problem_statement.md](docs/problem_statement.md) for the full official problem statement.

## Data

Raw challenge data is intentionally **not** stored in this repository.
See [data/README.md](data/README.md) for how to set it up locally.

## Setup

Python 3.13 with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Status

- Candidate generation / blocking (`src/blocking`): implemented. See
  [docs/blocking_handoff.md](docs/blocking_handoff.md) for how to generate and consume
  candidates, and [docs/blocking_data_analysis.md](docs/blocking_data_analysis.md) for the analysis
  and measured results.
- Matching, evaluation and final pipeline: not implemented yet.

Run the tests with `python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`
